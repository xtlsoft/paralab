# Paralab

Paralab is a brand new HPC compete and play platform. It provides a full-featured cloud-native CI (Continuous Integration) module which is compatible with existing HPC ecosystem (e.g. Slurm). It also provides a web-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for users to develop and debug their codes. Paralab is designed to be a platform for HPC users to compete and play with each other. It is also a platform for HPC researchers to develop and test their new ideas.

## Features

- **Cloud-native CI**: Paralab provides a full-featured cloud-native CI module which is compatible with existing HPC ecosystem (e.g. Slurm). It supports both static and dynamic analysis. It also supports both unit test and integration test. It can be easily integrated with existing CI tools (e.g. Jenkins, Gitlab CI, etc.) to provide a better CI experience for HPC users.
- **Web-based IDE**: Paralab provides a web-based IDE for users to develop and debug their codes. It supports both C/C++ and Fortran. It also supports both serial and parallel programs. It can be easily integrated with existing IDEs (e.g. VSCode, Eclipse, etc.) to provide a better IDE experience for HPC users.
- **Compete and play**: Paralab is designed to be a platform for HPC users to compete and play with each other. It is also a platform for HPC researchers to develop and test their new ideas.
